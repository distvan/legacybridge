# LegacyBridge PHP

Incremental modernization for legacy PHP applications, without rewrites.

LegacyBridge PHP allows existing, non PSR PHP applications to run inside a modern PSR-compliant request lifecycle. 
It enables **safe, incremental migration** toward modern PHP architecture while respecting real world constraints.

LegacyBridge is **not a framework**. It is a **bridge**.
